A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only memory mappings. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to gain write access to otherwise read-only memory mappings and thus increase their privileges on the system, the exploit is fully explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCKhmPTDurg.

Dirty COW vulnerability affects all versions of the Linux Kernel since version 2.6.22, which was released in 2007. According to Wikipedia, the vulnerability has been patched in kernel versions 4.8. 3, 4.7.
# Exploitation

To use this exploit modify the user values according to your needs.

The default user being created is `firefart`.

Compile with:

```bash
gcc -pthread dirtyCOW.c -o dirtyCOW -lcrypt
```

Then run the newly create binary by either doing:

```bash
./dirtyCOW
or
./dirtyCOW my-new-password
```

Afterwards, you can either `su firefart` or `ssh firefart@<ip address>`

**Note: DON'T FORGET TO RESTORE YOUR /etc/passwd AFTER RUNNING THE EXPLOIT!**

```bash
mv /tmp/passwd.bak /etc/passwd
```
