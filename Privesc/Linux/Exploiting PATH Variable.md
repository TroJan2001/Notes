PATH is an environmental variable in Linux and Unix-like operating systems which specifies directories that hold executable programs. When the user runs any command in the terminal, it searches for executable files with the help of the PATH Variable in response to commands executed by a user.
# Useful Commands:

To view the Path of the relevant user:

```bash
echo $PATH
```
# Exploiting $PATH

First, let's suppose we have a SUID binary file. Running it, we can see that it’s calling the system shell to do a basic process like list processes with "ls", now what we can do is add a to add a path to $PATH variable like /tmp for example using the following command:

```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Then, we will write a script that executes a shell and name it with the same command name that the SUID binary file uses, for example echo "/bin/bash" > ls . Here is the Syntax:

```bash
echo "[whatever command we want to run]" > [name of the executable we are imitating]
```

Finally we will use `chmod +x ls` to make it executable and just run the SUID binary file, and what will happen that the script inside the SUID binary will run the `ls` command inside the `tmp` folder instead of the one in `/bin/bash` for example.

To reset the PATH variable back to default, use the following command:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr//games:/usr/local/games:$PATH
```
