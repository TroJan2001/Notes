Hydra is a very fast online password cracking tool, which can perform rapid dictionary attacks against more than 50 Protocols, including Telnet, RDP, SSH, FTP, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, several databases and much more.

# Useful Commands:

```bash
hydra -t 4 -l <username> -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV <ip address> <protocol>
```

For http post form

```bash
hydra -l <username> -P <wordlist> <url or ip> http-post-form "<path to page in this style /x/y/z.php>:<username>=^USER^&<password>=^PASS^:F=<wrong password>"
```

**Note: for the http post form the username and password tokens could be found either in the page source code or intercepted burp suite request, and for the F parameter it is used to tell what responses to count as false response if the string after = was found for example "wrong password"**
### Other switches:

|**Section** | **Function** |  
| :-------:| :------:|
|hydra|Runs the hydra tool| 
|-t|Number of parallel connections per target|
|-I|Points to the username which we are trying to brute force its password|
|-P|Points to the wordlist path|
|-vV|Sets verbose mode to very verbose|
|[machine IP]|The IP address of the target machine|
|ftp / protocol|Sets the protocol|

To see the special option of a module use: 
```bash
hydra -U <module>
```

**Important Note taken from Metasploit Exploitation room:** 

Can't bruteforce via Hydra but doable with smb_login module in Metasploit?!

Got the answer after researching and its about using `-m "local LMv2" `  which changes the type of the hash used in the to match the SMB server type since it is the old used hash type and the default is NTLM hash so that's why it doesn't work. On the other hand, smb_login module in Metasploit just uses the hash based on the SMB version so it works.
