Reverse SSH port forwarding specifies that the given port on the remote server host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.

**-L** is a local tunnel (YOU <-- CLIENT). If a site was blocked, you can forward the traffic to a server you own and view it. For example, if imgur was blocked at work, you can do **ssh -L 9000:imgur.com:80 user@example.com.** Going to localhost:9000 on your machine, will load imgur traffic using your other server.

**-R** is a remote tunnel (YOU --> CLIENT). You forward your traffic to the other server for others to view. Similar to the example above, but in reverse.
(we do this because maybe I want someone to access a webserver on my local machine for example, but local machine can't be accessed using a private ip, so we make the local machine connect to public machine using ssh and then it offers the port that we can connect to)
