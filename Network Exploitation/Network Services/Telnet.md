Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.
# Useful Commands:

You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: 

```bash
telnet [ip] [port]
```

**Note: we can the following command to start a tcpdump listener on your local machine to test any incoming icmp packets:
 
```bash
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i tun0
```
# Telnet Exploiting:

First we try `nmap -p-` since the telnet might not be on the default port.

**Method Breakdown**

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - There is a poorly hidden telnet service running on this machine

    - The service itself is marked "backdoor"

    - We have possible username of "Skidy" implicated

Next, we use the command mention under [[Telnet#Useful Commands]] section to connect to a telnet server, and we try to ping out machine using a tcpdump listener which is also mention under [[Telnet#Useful Commands]] section and try to ping our machine from the remote server using the following command `ping <local ip address> -c 1` .

**Note:** we used the `-c 1` to stop after stop after `<c>` replies so we don't get stuck in a loop pinging infinitely.

Finally, we open a listening port on our local machine using `sudo nc -lvp 4444` or `sudo rlwrap nc -lvp 4444` which enhance the shell, allowing you to use shortcuts like `[CTRL] + [L] or [CTRL] + [C]`, we use one of the commands mentioned under [[Reverse shells#Useful Commands]] section to use one of the payloads and use them on the remote machine to get a reverse shell session.
