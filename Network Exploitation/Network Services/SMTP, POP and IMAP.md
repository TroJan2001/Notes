# SMTP

SMTP stands for "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol". It is utilized to handle the sending of emails. In order to support email services, a protocol pair is required, comprising of SMTP and POP/IMAP. Together they allow the user to send outgoing mail and retrieve incoming mail, respectively, basically the default port for SMTP is 25.

The SMTP server performs three basic functions:

-  It verifies who is sending emails through the SMTP server.
-  It sends the outgoing mail
-  If the outgoing mail can't be delivered it sends the message back to the sender

# POP and IMAP

POP, or "Post Office Protocol" and IMAP, "Internet Message Access Protocol" are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server.

The main differences is in POP's mails are downloaded to the client side and deleted from the server. Where IMAP will synchronize the current inbox, with new mail on the server, downloading anything new. This means that changes to the inbox made on one computer, over IMAP, will persist if you then synchronize the inbox from another computer. The POP/IMAP server is responsible for fulfilling this process.

SMTP for sending, POP and IMAP for receiving:

1. The mail user agent, which is either your email client or an external program. connects to the SMTP server of your domain, e.g. smtp.google.com. This initiates the SMTP handshake. This connection works over the SMTP port- which is usually 25. Once these connections have been made and validated, the SMTP session starts.  

2. The process of sending mail can now begin. The client first submits the sender, and recipient's email address- the body of the email and any attachments, to the server.  

3. The SMTP server then checks whether the domain name of the recipient and the sender is the same.

4. The SMTP server of the sender will make a connection to the recipient's SMTP server before relaying the email. If the recipient's server can't be accessed, or is not available- the Email gets put into an SMTP queue.  

5. Then, the recipient's SMTP server will verify the incoming email. It does this by checking if the domain and user name have been recognised. The server will then forward the email to the POP or IMAP server, as shown in the diagram above.  

6. The E-Mail will then show up in the recipient's inbox.

This is a very simplified version of the process, and there are a lot of sub-protocols, communications and details that haven't been included.

SMTP Server software is readily available on Windows server platforms, with many other variants of SMTP being available to run on Linux.

# SMTP Exploiting:
  
First, lets run a port scan against the target machine and get the open port for SMTP.

Then, we use the `auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version` in the msfconsole (Metasploit).

After setting the right options in the module and run it, we get the system mail name and Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) .

Next, we use the auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum tp enumerate users that are present on the remote system, and we set USER_FILE to be _top-usernames-shortlist.txt_ wordlist which is one of the seclists wordlists, and when we run we the module we will wait for a username to be returned.

Okay, at the end of our Enumeration section we have a few vital pieces of information:

1. A user account name  

2. The type of SMTP server and Operating System running.

Finally, we will try to use Hydra [[../../Web Pentesting/Hydra#Useful Commands]] tool to crack the password of the possible username we found through the enumeration using the following command:

```bash
hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV MACHINE_IP ssh
```
