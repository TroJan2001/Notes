After this overview of iptables and nftables, you might have started to develop the impression that configuring firewalls on Linux is a cumbersome, error-prone process. We already mentioned that iptables is like a front-end to netfilter; however, we can simplify things by providing a front-end to the front-end!

Example front-ends to iptables are shown in the figure below and can be divided into:

- Command-line Interface (CLI) front-ends, such as firewalld and ufw.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) front-ends, such as fwbuilder.

UFW stands for uncomplicated firewall. Let’s see how it stands for its promise of being _uncomplicated_. We will allow SSH traffic. This firewall rule can be achieved through one of the following commands:

`ufw allow 22/tcp`

It configures the firewall to `allow` traffic to TCP port 22. We can confirm our settings with the command `ufw status`.
