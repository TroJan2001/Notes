Netfilter is a packet filter and firewall implemented in the standard Linux kernel.

At the very core, we have netfilter. The netfilter project provides packet-filtering software for the Linux kernel 2.4.x and later versions. The netfilter hooks require a front-end such as `iptables` or `nftables` to manage.
# Linux Firewalls

The first Linux firewall was a packet filtering firewall, i.e., a stateless firewall. A stateless firewall can inspect certain fields in the IP and TCP/UDP headers to decide upon a packet but does not maintain information about ongoing TCP connections. As a result, a packet can manipulate a few TCP flags to appear as if it is part of an ongoing connection and evade certain restrictions. Current Linux firewalls are stateful firewalls; they keep track of ongoing connections and restrict packets based on specific fields in the IP and TCP/UDP headers and based on whether the packet is part of an ongoing connection.

The IP header fields that find their way into the firewall rules are:

1. Source IP address
2. Destination IP address

The TCP/UDP header fields that are of primary concern for firewall rules are:

1. Source TCP/UDP port
2. Destination TCP/UDP port
