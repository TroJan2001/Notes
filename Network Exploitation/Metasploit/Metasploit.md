Metasploit is the most widely used exploitation framework. Metasploit is a powerful tool that can support all phases of a penetration testing engagement, from information gathering to post-exploitation.

The Metasploit Framework is a set of tools that allow information gathering, scanning, exploitation, exploit development, post-exploitation, and more. While the primary usage of the Metasploit Framework focuses on the penetration testing domain, it is also useful for vulnerability research and exploit development.

The main components of the Metasploit Framework can be summarized as follows;

- **msfconsole**: The main command-line interface.
- **Modules**: supporting modules such as exploits, scanners, payloads, etc.
- **Tools**: Stand-alone tools that will help vulnerability research, vulnerability assessment, or penetration testing. Some of these tools are msfvenom, pattern_create and pattern_offset. We will cover msfvenom within this module, but pattern_create and pattern_offset are tools useful in exploit development which is beyond the scope of this module.

## Concepts:

- **Exploit:** a piece of code that uses a vulnerability present on the target system.
- **Vulnerability:** A design, coding, or logic flaw affecting the target system. The exploitation of a vulnerability can result in disclosing confidential information or allowing the attacker to execute code on the target system.
- **Payload:** An exploit will take advantage of a vulnerability. However, if we want the exploit to have the result we want (gaining access to the target system, read confidential information, etc.), we need to use a payload. Payloads are the code that will run on the target system.

## Modules:

**Auxiliary:** Any supporting module, such as scanners, crawlers and fuzzers, can be found here.

**Encoders:** Encoders will allow you to encode the exploit and payload in the hope that a signature-based antivirus solution may miss them, kind of antivirus evasion.

**Evasion:** While encoders will encode the payload, they should not be considered a direct attempt to evade antivirus software. On the other hand, “evasion” modules will try that, with more or less success.

**Exploits:** Already Defined, neatly organized by target system.

**NOPs:** stands for no operation which means will do nothing literally for 1 cycle, often used to achieve consistent payload sizes.

**Payloads:** codes that will run on the target system to achieve the desired result after exploiting, **Note that staged payloads could be known by / between "shell" and "reverse" but single use __ instead like so:**

- generic/shell_reverse_tcp (single)
- windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp (staged)

**Post:** modules that are basically used on the final stage of the penetration testing process listed above, post-exploitation.
