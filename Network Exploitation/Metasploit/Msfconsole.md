The main command-line interface of Metasploit tool.
# Useful Commands:

To launch Metasploit tool we use:

```bash
msfconsole
```

To search for a module we use:

```msfconsole
search <module>
```

To use a module you would either have to get the full path of the module which could be found using the search command or followed by the number at the beginning of the search result line:

```msfconsole
use <full path>
or
use <number at the beginning of the result line>
```

The `show` command can be used in any context followed by a module type (auxiliary, payload, exploit, etc.) to list available modules for example:

```msfconsole
show options
```

Most of the exploits will have a preset default payload. However, we can always use the `show payloads` command to list other commands we can use with that specific exploit.

```msfconsole
show payloads
```

we can use the the following command to set a payload:

```msfconsole
set payload
```

==**Other commands:** ==
we can use ```back``` command to leave the context.

Further information on any module can be obtained by typing the `info` command within its context.

Also, ```set``` and ```unset``` commands are essential commands that are used to set and unset the parameters respectively.

To clear set parameters you can use the `unset all` command.

You can also use ```setg``` and ```unsetg``` to set and unset the global parameters respectively which is the same as set and unset but it makes the value default for all modules.

To use a module after it is set and ready:

```msfconsole
run
or
exploit
```

**Note:** if you want to background a session use ```exploit -z``` or you can simply run it normally and wait for the session to run then use ```background``` command, but if you want to background a job we can use `exploit -j`.
Alternatively, `CTRL+Z` can be used to background sessions.

Some modules support the `check` option. This will check if the target system is vulnerable without exploiting it.

To see the existing sessions use the first command, and to interact with any session, you can use the second command:

```msfconsole
sessions
```

```msfconsole
sessions -i <session number>
```
