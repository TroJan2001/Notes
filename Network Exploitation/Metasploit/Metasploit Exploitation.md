To use Metasploit for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. Also, cover how the database feature makes it easier to manage penetration testing engagements with a broader scope. Finally, look at generating payloads with msfvenom and how to start a Meterpreter session on most target platforms.
# Useful Commands:

To make a port scan we can simply use some modules that could be find by using the following command in Metasploit shell:

```msfconsole
search portscan
```

**Note:** The `scanner/discovery/udp_sweep` module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol). As you can see below, this module will not conduct an extensive scan of all possible UDP services but does provide a quick way to identify services such as DNS or NetBIOS.

To make a SMB Scan we can simply use some modules that could be find by using the following command in Metasploit shell:

```msfconsole
smb_enumshares
```

```msfconsole
smb_version
```


# Extra: Useful modules

- netbios/nbname: to get the NetBIOS name.
- smb_login: to bruteforce the smb server.
