Nmap provides the option `-f` to fragment packets. Once chosen, the IP data will be divided into 8 bytes or less. Adding another `-f` (`-f -f` or `-ff`) will split the data into 16 byte-fragments instead of 8. You can change the default value by using the `--mtu`; however, you should always choose a multiple of 8.

To properly understand fragmentation, we need to look at the IP header in the figure below. It might look complicated at first, but we notice that we know most of its fields. In particular, notice the source address taking 32 bits (4 bytes) on the fourth row, while the destination address is taking another 4 bytes on the fifth row. The data that we will fragment across multiple packets is highlighted in red. To aid in the reassembly on the recipient side, IP uses the identification (ID) and fragment offset, shown on the second row of the figure below.

Let’s compare running `sudo nmap -sS -p80 10.20.30.144` and `sudo nmap -sS -p80 -f 10.20.30.144`. As you know by now, this will use stealth TCP SYN scan on port 80; however, in the second command, we are requesting Nmap to fragment the IP packets.

In the first two lines, we can see an ARP query and response. Nmap issued an ARP query because the target is on the same Ethernet. The second two lines show a TCP SYN ping and a reply. The fifth line is the beginning of the port scan; Nmap sends a TCP SYN packet to port 80. In this case, the IP header is 20 bytes, and the TCP header is 24 bytes. Note that the minimum size of the TCP header is 20 bytes.

With fragmentation requested via `-f`, the 24 bytes of the TCP header will be divided into multiples of 8 bytes, with the last fragment containing 8 bytes or less of the TCP header. Since 24 is divisible by 8, we got 3 IP fragments; each has 20 bytes of IP header and 8 bytes of TCP header. We can see the three fragments between the fifth and the seventh lines.

Note that if you added `-ff` (or `-f -f`), the fragmentation of the data will be multiples of 16. In other words, the 24 bytes of the TCP header, in this case, would be divided over two IP fragments, the first containing 16 bytes and the second containing 8 bytes of the TCP header.

On the other hand, if you prefer to increase the size of your packets to make them look innocuous, you can use the option `--data-length NUM`, where num specifies the number of bytes you want to append to your packets.
