A summary for Nmap Basic Port Scans room:

This room covered three types of scans.

|Port Scan Type|Example Command|
|---|---|
|TCP Connect Scan|`nmap -sT 10.10.64.52`|
|TCP SYN Scan|`sudo nmap -sS 10.10.64.52`|
|UDP Scan|`sudo nmap -sU 10.10.64.52`|
It is important to note that if you are not a privileged user (root or sudoer), a TCP connect scan is the only possible option to discover open TCP ports `-sT`.

TCP SYN scan is the default scan mode when running Nmap as a privileged user, running as root or using sudo, and it is a very reliable choice. It has successfully discovered the open ports you found earlier with the TCP connect scan, yet no TCP connection was fully established with the target `-sS`.

Note that we can use `-F` to enable fast mode and decrease the number of scanned ports from 1000 to 100 most common ports.

It is worth mentioning that the `-r` option can also be added to scan the ports in consecutive order instead of random order. This option is useful when testing whether ports open in a consistent manner, for instance, when a target boots up.

These scan types should get you started discovering running TCP and UDP services on a target host.

|Option|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`-p-`|all ports|
|`-p1-1023`|scan ports 1 to 1023|
|`-F`|100 most common ports|
|`-r`|scan ports in consecutive order|
|`-T<0-5>`|-T0 being the slowest and T5 the fastest|
|`--max-rate 50`|rate <= 50 packets/sec|
|`--min-rate 15`|rate >= 15 packets/sec|
|`--min-parallelism 100`|at least 100 probes in parallel|
