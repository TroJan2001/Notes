- **Confidentiality** ensures that only the intended persons or recipients can access the data.
- **Integrity** aims to ensure that the data cannot be altered; moreover, we can detect any alteration if it occurs.
- **Availability** aims to ensure that the system or service is available when needed.
- **Authenticity**: Authentic means not fraudulent or counterfeit. Authenticity is about ensuring that the document/file/data is from the claimed source.
- **Nonrepudiation**: Repudiate means refusing to recognize the validity of something. Nonrepudiation ensures that the original source cannot deny that they are the source of a particular document/file/data. This characteristic is indispensable for various domains, such as shopping, patient diagnosis, and banking.
- **Utility**: Utility focuses on the usefulness of the information. For instance, a user might have lost the decryption key to access a laptop with encrypted storage. Although the user still has the laptop with its disk(s) intact, they cannot access them. In other words, although still available, the information is in a form that is not useful, i.e., of no utility.
- **Possession**: This security element requires that we protect the information from unauthorized taking, copying, or controlling. For instance, an adversary might take a backup drive, meaning we lose possession of the information as long as they have the drive. Alternatively, the adversary might succeed in encrypting our data using ransomware; this also leads to the loss of possession of the data.
- **Disclosure** is the opposite of confidentiality. In other words, disclosure of confidential data would be an attack on confidentiality.
- **Alteration** is the opposite of Integrity. For example, the integrity of a cheque is indispensable.
- **Destruction/Denial** is the opposite of Availability.
- **Vulnerability**: Vulnerable means susceptible to attack or damage. In information security, a vulnerability is a weakness.
- **Threat**: A threat is a potential danger associated with this weakness or vulnerability.
- **Risk**: The risk is concerned with the likelihood of a threat actor exploiting a vulnerability and the consequent impact on.

# IAAA

In the IAAA Model, IAAA stands for Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability. The four stages of the IAAA model are:

1. **Identification** is the process of verifying who the user is. It starts with the user claiming a specific identity. The identity can be represented by a unique identifier such as an email address, a username, or an ID number. Any identifier unique in the respective environment is a valid option; hence, many websites would rely on an email address for identification instead of asking the user to create a unique username.
2. **Authentication** is the process of ensuring that the user is who they claim to be. In other words, this step is about confirming the claimed identity. One way to authenticate would be by providing the correct password. Because of potential password weaknesses, many other methods, such as asking users to type the code sent to their email, are gaining popularity.
3. **Authorisation** determines what the user is allowed to access. In other words, they will be authorised to carry out specific operations based on their account privileges. This process is typically done by assigning roles and permissions based on the user’s job function or level of clearance. The risk of unauthorised access or data breaches is reduced by restricting access to only the resources necessary for the user to perform their duties.
4. **Accountability** tracks user activity to ensure they are responsible for their actions. After a user is granted access to a system, it is essential to have mechanisms that hold everyone accountable for their actions. This process is achieved by logging all user activity and storing it in a centralised location. In the event of a security incident, this information can be used to identify the source of the problem and take appropriate action.
