With the command shell, you can directly interact with the operating system. Think command prompt as an interpreter that accepts the commands or the user’s inputs and translates them into machine language.

### Useful commands:

The command ==**hostname**== will output the computer name:

```cmd
hostname
```

The command ==**whoami**== will output the name of the logged-in user:

```cmd
whoami
```

The command ==ipconfig== will show the network address settings for the computer:

```cmd
ipconfig
```

  **Note:** a command to retrieve the help manual for a command is ==`/?`==
  **Note**: To clear the command prompt screen, the command is ==`cls`==.

The command ==netstat== will display protocol statistics and current TCP/IP network connections:

```cmd
netstat
```

The ==`net`== command is primarily used to manage network resources. This command supports sub-commands.

For the net command, to display the help manual ==`/?`== will not work. In this case, you need to use different syntax, which is ==`net help`==.

So, if you wish to see the help information for ==`net user`== , the command is ==`net help user`==.

You can use the same command to view the help information for other useful **net** sub-commands, such as ==**localgroup**==, ==**use**==, ==**share**==, and ==**session**==.
