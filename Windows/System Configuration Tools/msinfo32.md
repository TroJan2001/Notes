==msinfo32== tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware.

The information displayed in ==**Hardware Resources**== is not for the average computer user. If you want to learn more about this section, refer to the official Microsoft [page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/hardware-resources#:~:text=Hardware%20resources%20are%20the%20assignable,of%20bus%2Drelative%20memory%20addresses.).

Under ==**Components**==, you can see specific information about the hardware devices installed on the computer. Some sections don't show any information, but some sections do, such as ==**Display**== and ==**Input**==.

In the ==**Software Environment**== section, you can see information about software baked into the operating system and software you have installed. Other details are visible in this section as well, such as the ==**Environment Variables**== and ==**Network Connections**==.

(The Windows\System32 Folder task) where ==**Environment Variables**== was briefly touched on.

Another method to view environment variables is `Control Panel > System and Security > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables` **OR** `Settings > System > About > system info > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables`.
