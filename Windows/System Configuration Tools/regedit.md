The ==**Windows Registry**== (per Microsoft) is a central hierarchical database used to store information necessary to configure the system for one or more users, applications, and hardware devices.

The registry contains information that Windows continually references during operation, such as:

- Profiles for each user
- Applications installed on the computer and the types of documents that each can create
- Property sheet settings for folders and application icons
- What hardware exists on the system
- The ports that are being used.

**Warning**: The registry is for advanced computer users. Making changes to the registry can affect normal computer operations.

Refer to the following Microsoft documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/performance/windows-registry-advanced-users) to learn more about the Windows Registry.

**Note:** The supporting files for all hives except HKEY_CURRENT_USER are in the `%SystemRoot%\System32\Config` folder on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista. The supporting files for HKEY_CURRENT_USER are in the `%SystemRoot%\Profiles\Username` folder
