Most log files on Linux systems are stored in the **`/var/log`** directory. Here are a few of the logs that can be referenced when looking into threats:

- `/var/log/messages` - a general log for Linux systems
- `/var/log/auth.log` - a log file that lists all authentication attempts (Debian-based systems)
- `/var/log/secure` - a log file that lists all authentication attempts (Red Hat and Fedora-based systems)
- `/var/log/utmp` - an access log that contains information regarding users that are currently logged into the system
- `/var/log/wtmp` - an access log that contains information for all users that have logged in and out of the system
- `/var/log/kern.log` - a log file containing messages from the kernel
- `/var/log/boot.log` - a log file that contains start-up messages and boot information

The table below provides a short and basic comparison between Linux logs and Windows logs.

# Useful Commands

- Since new events are appended to the log file, you can view the last few lines using `tail`. For example, `tail -n 12 boot.log` will display the last 12 lines.
- One way to search log lines containing a specific keyword is using the command `grep`. For instance, `grep FAILED boot.log` will only show the lines with the word `FAILED`.

Note that you must be logged in as root or precede your commands with `sudo` to view the system log files.
