Filtering is a defence mechanisms used to prevent malicious file uploads.

let's take a look at some different kinds of filtering.  

_Extension Validation:_

File extensions are used (in theory) to identify the contents of a file. Filters that check for extensions work in one of two ways. They either _blacklist_ extensions (i.e. have a list of extensions which are **not** allowed) or they _whitelist_ extensions (i.e. have a list of extensions which **are** allowed, and reject everything else).

_File Type Filtering:_

Similar to Extension validation, but more intensive, file type filtering looks, once again, to verify that the contents of a file are acceptable to upload. We'll be looking at two types of file type validation:  

- _MIME validation:_ MIME (**M**ultipurpose **I**nternet **M**ail **E**xtension) types are used as an identifier for files -- originally when transferred as attachments over email, but now also when files are being transferred over HTTP(S). The MIME type for a file upload is attached in the header of the request, and looks something like this:  
	
   ![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231105005337.png)   
    MIME types follow the format /. In the request above, you can see that the image "spaniel.jpg" was uploaded to the server. As a legitimate JPEG image, the MIME type for this upload was "image/jpeg". The MIME type for a file can be checked client-side and/or server-side; however, as MIME is based on the extension of the file, this is extremely easy to bypass.  
     
- _Magic Number validation**:**_ Magic numbers are the more accurate way of determining the contents of a file; although, they are by no means impossible to fake. The "magic number" of a file is a string of bytes at the very beginning of the file content which identify the content. For example, a PNG file would have these bytes at the very top of the file: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`.  
   ![](../Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231105005355.png)  
    Unlike Windows, Unix systems use magic numbers for identifying files; however, when dealing with file uploads, it is possible to check the magic number of the uploaded file to ensure that it is safe to accept. This is by no means a guaranteed solution, but it's more effective than checking the extension of a file.

_File Length Filtering:_

File length filters are used to prevent huge files from being uploaded to the server via an upload form (as this can potentially starve the server of resources). In most cases this will not cause us any issues when we upload shells; however, it's worth bearing in mind that if an upload form only expects a very small file to be uploaded, there may be a length filter in place to ensure that the file length requirement is adhered to.

_File Name Filtering:_

As touched upon previously, files uploaded to a server should be unique. Usually this would mean adding a random aspect to the file name, however, an alternative strategy would be to check if a file with the same name already exists on the server, and give the user an error if so. Additionally, file names should be sanitised on upload to ensure that they don't contain any "bad characters", which could potentially cause problems on the file system when uploaded (e.g. null bytes or forward slashes on Linux, as well as control characters such as `;` and potentially unicode characters). What this means for us is that, on a well administered system, our uploaded files are unlikely to have the same name we gave them before uploading.

_File Content Filtering:_

More complicated filtering systems may scan the full contents of an uploaded file to ensure that it's not spoofing its extension, MIME type and Magic Number. This is a significantly more complex process than the majority of basic filtration systems employ, and thus will not be covered in this room.
### Bypassing Client-Side Filters

There are four easy ways to bypass your average client-side file upload filter:

1. _Turn off Javascript in your browser_ -- this will work provided the site doesn't require Javascript in order to provide basic functionality. If turning off Javascript completely will prevent the site from working at all then one of the other methods would be more desirable; otherwise, this can be an effective way of completely bypassing the client-side filter.
2. _Intercept and modify the incoming page._ Using Burpsuite, we can intercept the incoming web page and strip out the Javascript filter before it has a chance to run, right click on the intercepted data (Request), scroll down to "Do Intercept", then select "Response to this request", `it's worth noting here that Burpsuite will not, by default, intercept any external Javascript files that the web page is loading. If you need to edit a script which is not inside the main page being loaded, you'll need to go to the "Options" tab at the top of the Burpsuite window, then under the "Intercept Client Requests" section, edit the condition of the first line to remove` `^js$|`.
3. _Intercept and modify the file upload_. Where the previous method works _before_ the webpage is loaded, this method allows the web page to load as normal, but intercepts the file upload after it's already passed (and been accepted by the filter), to do this we can rename the shell to shell.jpg for example according to what file extension does the  filter allows, then press upload and intercept the upload, finally we must change MIME type to `text/x-php` and file extension to `.php` and the filter will be bypassed. 
4. _Send the file directly to the upload point._ Why use the webpage with the filter, when you can send the file directly using a tool like `curl`? Posting the data directly to the page which contains the code for handling the file upload is another effective method for completely bypassing a client side filter. We will not be covering this method in any real depth in this tutorial, however, the syntax for such a command would look something like this: `curl -X POST -F "submit:<value>" -F "<file-parameter>:@<path-to-file>" <site>`. To use this method you would first aim to intercept a successful upload (using Burpsuite or the browser console) to see the parameters being used in the upload, which can then be slotted into the above command.
### Bypassing Server-Side Filters

#### File Extensions

Since we cant see the code that filters the uploaded file in Server-Side Filters, we can either: 

1. Try a few common extensions that webservers may nonetheless still recognise assuming a blacklist is being used and we try to bypass it, for instance if we want to upload a php file and the  code is filtering out the `.php` and `.phtml` extensions so we can try many other extensions like: `.php3`, `.php4`, `.php5`, `.php7`, `.phps`, `.php-s`, `.pht` and `.phar`.
2. The server might be filtering after the first `.` so we may try to upload something like `shell.jpg.php` to bypass it.
#### Magic Numbers

We can use hexeditor tool to change the first hexadecimal digits of a file to spoof its type.

# Exploiting

These steps are identically taken from Upload Vulnerabilities room in THM:

 Let's say that we've been given a website to perform a security audit on.

1. The first thing we would do is take a look at the website as a whole. Using browser extensions such as the aforementioned Wappalyzer (or by hand) we would look for indicators of what languages and frameworks the web application might have been built with. Be aware that Wappalyzer is not always 100% accurate. A good start to enumerating this manually would be by making a request to the website and intercepting the response with Burpsuite. Headers such as `server` or `x-powered-by` can be used to gain information about the server. We would also be looking for vectors of attack, like, for example, an upload page.  

2. Having found an upload page, we would then aim to inspect it further. Looking at the source code for client-side scripts to determine if there are any client-side filters to bypass would be a good thing to start with, as this is completely in our control.
3. We would then attempt a completely innocent file upload. From here we would look to see how our file is accessed. In other words, can we access it directly in an uploads folder? Is it embedded in a page somewhere? What's the naming scheme of the website? This is where tools such as Gobuster might come in if the location is not immediately obvious. This step is extremely important as it not only improves our knowledge of the virtual landscape we're attacking, it also gives us a baseline "accepted" file which we can base further testing on.
    - An important Gobuster switch here is the `-x` switch, which can be used to look for files with specific extensions. For example, if you added `-x php,txt,html` to your Gobuster command, the tool would append `.php`, `.txt`, and `.html` to each word in the selected wordlist, one at a time. This can be very useful if you've managed to upload a payload and the server is changing the name of uploaded files.
4. Having ascertained how and where our uploaded files can be accessed, we would then attempt a malicious file upload, bypassing any client-side filters we found in step two. We would expect our upload to be stopped by a server side filter, but the error message that it gives us can be extremely useful in determining our next steps.

Assuming that our malicious file upload has been stopped by the server, here are some ways to ascertain what kind of server-side filter may be in place:

- If you can successfully upload a file with a totally invalid file extension (e.g. `testingimage.invalidfileextension`) then the chances are that the server is using an extension _blacklist_ to filter out executable files. If this upload fails then any extension filter will be operating on a whitelist.
- Try re-uploading your originally accepted innocent file, but this time change the magic number of the file to be something that you would expect to be filtered. If the upload fails then you know that the server is using a magic number based filter.
- As with the previous point, try to upload your innocent file, but intercept the request with Burpsuite and change the MIME type of the upload to something that you would expect to be filtered. If the upload fails then you know that the server is filtering based on MIME types.
- Enumerating file length filters is a case of uploading a small file, then uploading progressively bigger files until you hit the filter. At that point you'll know what the acceptable limit is. If you're very lucky then the error message of original upload may outright tell you what the size limit is. Be aware that a small file length limit may prevent you from uploading the reverse shell we've been using so far.
